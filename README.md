Experimenter platform is the environment for designing and evaluating eye-tracking-based User-Adaptive Interfaces (UAI), i.e., interfaces that can adapt in real-time to their users based on their gaze behaviors. Such adaptation can include, for instance, dynamically changing the layout of the interfaces, enabling/disabling functionalities, highlighting relevant parts of the interface, adding visual cues… The platform contains the essential functionalities to support experimenters (e.g., researchers, companies) in implementing such gaze-based adaptive systems, and test them via a user study. 

To get started, the documentation folder contains:
- a User Manual that provides an overview of the platform and explains how to use the platform to design and render user adaptive interventions, as well as how to design a user study with the platform to evaluate the adaptation (optional).
- a Technical Documentation that defines that specific components of the platform.

The platform was implemented in 2018-2019 by the IUI Group of the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver BC, Canada).
